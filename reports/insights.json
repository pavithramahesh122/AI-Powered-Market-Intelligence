    "report_summary": "The mobile app market, comprising over 10,500 apps, is predominantly free (92.52%). Gaming is the leading category by total installs, demonstrating significant market traction despite a relatively moderate sentiment polarity. While free apps capture the vast majority of the market, paid apps achieve slightly higher average user ratings, indicating a segment valuing quality. Opportunities exist in categories with strong positive sentiment like Health and Photography, and in optimizing monetization for high-install categories such as Communication and Social, which show high per-app engagement.",
